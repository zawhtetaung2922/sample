                   In Myanmar, there are three schools for the deaf in Yangon, in Mandalay and in Kalay but the language
                   used at each school is not the same. In this project, sign language used at Yangon Deaf School is utilized
                   and it is mainly implemented for those who wants to learn sign language using Matlab software.</p>
